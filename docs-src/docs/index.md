# ORM::Factory

The latest version of this documentation lives at [https://gdonald.github.io/ORM-Factory/](https://gdonald.github.io/ORM-Factory/).

The homepage for ORM::Factory is [https://github.com/gdonald/ORM-Factory](https://github.com/gdonald/ORM-Factory).

## Synopsis

`ORM::Factory` is a Raku port of Ruby's
[`factory_bot`](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot): a definition DSL
for building test objects (with or without persistence) so your specs stay
declarative.

It is ORM-agnostic at its core. With
[`ORM::ActiveRecord`](https://github.com/gdonald/ORM-ActiveRecord) installed
and auto-detected, `create` persists through the model's `save-or-die` with
validations, callbacks, and timestamps intact. With no ORM loaded, factories
still build plain objects, and the `to-create` / `initialize-with` hooks let
you target any persistence layer.

## Example usage

```perl6
use ORM::Factory;

ORM::Factory.define: {
  .factory: 'user', {
    .fname: 'Greg';
    .lname: 'Donald';
    .email: { 'user@example.com' };

    .variant: 'admin', {
      .role: 'admin';
    };
  };
};
```

## Install

`ORM::Factory` can be installed using the [zef](https://github.com/ugexe/zef)
module installation tool:

```
zef install --/test ORM::Factory
```

`--/test` is suggested because the full suite exercises every supported
adapter (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite). The library itself has no runtime
dependencies; `ORM::ActiveRecord` is a `test-depends` and is auto-detected at
runtime when installed.

## Where to go next

- [Getting started](getting-started.md) — define and use your first factory.
- [DSL design](dsl-design.md) — the rationale behind the topic-`$_` + `FALLBACK` DSL surface.
- [Tests](tests.md) — running the suite, the `t/` ↔ `specs/` mirror convention, and the `db/` vs unit layout.
